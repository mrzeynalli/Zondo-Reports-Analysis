# Zondo-Reports-Analysis

 This repo contains a text analysis from Zondo Reports based in South African corruption findigns.
 
In 2018, former President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, established a commission of enquiry in state capture, known as [The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of State](https://www.statecapture.org.za/), or simply the Zondo Commission. The commission collected one exabyte of evidence, and on 22 June 2022 released its final report. 

Among the guilty parties mentioned in the [reports](https://www.statecapture.org.za/site/information/reports), are publicly listed companies on the [Johannesburg Stock Exchange](https://www.jse.co.za/), which form part of many investment portfolios. This report aims to identify which of these companies are potentially implicated to inform ethical investment decisionÂ making.

The findings are given in a mini report at the very botton of the working file
